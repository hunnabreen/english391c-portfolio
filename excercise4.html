	<h1>Potential mock site ideas</h1>
	
	<h2>Cryptocurrency website</h2>
	<br/>
		<p>Based off of the controversial Bitcoin, this psuedo site would model the often sleek design of similar technologies that exist in the cryptocurrency realm. This site would have some logo to give it a brand identity, and would show core features of the technology. It would have an about page that explained what the goal of the technology would be, as well as its origins. It would have links to platforms that delt with the cryptocurrency. </p>

	<h2>Campus Record Label</h2>
	<br/>
		<p>Concrete Valley Records is UMass' student run record label. The website would boast colors that resemble UMass, however it be embellished with its own unique creative side. The record label would have liken itself to any other student run organization, however it would have to display somewhat of a mission statement, and a roster of artists on the label. These artists would attend the five college consortioum, and there would be a page that had a list on the label. There would be an about page, that had all of the mission statements of the label, and would have profiles on all of the faculty of the label. There would also be a contact page, where people can send demo tapes of their music, as well as general content. </p>

	<h3>Hotel resort website</h3>
	<br/>
		<p>Escape is a timeshare community in the Florida Keys and is a getaway for anyone looking to escape the harsh winters of these months. These beach front properties would show places to dine, entertainment in the area, services provided, nightly rates and packages.</p>
