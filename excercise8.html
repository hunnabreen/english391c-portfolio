    <h3>Humble Beginnings</h3>
    <p>Born and raised in the Metro West area of Massachusetts, I've been around Boston my whole life. The bean gave me opportunities in academia and in the arts.
    <br> 
    Since day one I loved playing with legos - utilizing skills in both engineering and creativity. I also sought adventure in the sparce yet riveting woods of the area, spending my energy climbing trees, digging my cleats out on the lacrosse field, or carving up the ice with my skates.</p>
    
    <h3>Here and Now</h3>
    <p>Eventually these interests led me to Umass Amherst, where I will be receiving a BS in Informatics, on the Data Science track. I have been fortunate enough to be able to combine the arts and the academia that Boston instilled on me. I spend my time making art using Autodesk Maya and the Adobe Creative Suite, making album covers and videos for friends and music producers alike. As for my education, I spend a bulk of my time coding, and learning how to code using web development tools such as HTML5 and CSS, programming languages such as Java and Python, and analytical tools such as R and SQL. I hope to combine the two to make data rich web sites, both sleek in design and functionality.
